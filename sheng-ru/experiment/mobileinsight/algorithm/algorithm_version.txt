v1: Follow by the Professor's advice first algorithm.
v2: Similar idea to that of version1, except forcus on preventing RLF from happening.
v3: same as v2 but change the predictor.
v4: 
    use R1 as main 5G radio; use R2 as compensate radio.
    R1 maintain no band-locking 5G. R2 maintain LTE only band-locking.
    R1 dont change but R2 change while action.
v5: 
    R1: 5G ; R2: LTE
    when ever detect an RLF action
v6:
    對照組： R1: 5G B1B8; R2: LTE
    演算法： R1: 5G B1B3; R2: LTE B7B8
